# Games by Chris Cemper - work in progress

These games were developed when I was age 14-17. After that I had to stop due to school. Shortly later that year my partner Yon took his life, which ended our entrepreneurial success story in the C64 games business. **RIP YON.**

| Game name        | What it is | Where I sold it to | Screenshot | More |

| Duotris                                       | first game released commercially by Jez and Yon. We sent out several copies, all byte-coded (with a special byte in the gamecode that idemtified the recipient in a hidden way...). The byte-code was needed pretty soon when a lamer of AMOK gave a copy of the game to Genesis Project, german cracking-group which boasted by cracking an unprotected game... Well after that we had mere troubles to find someone paying for it, but well.. we did. | Published: Game On Magazine via CP Verlag (1989)             | [![Duotris title](duotris-ingame1.gif)](http://web.archive.org/web/20160406100959/http://c64.cemper.com/MyGames/duotris.html) | more [here...](http://web.archive.org/web/20160406100959/http://c64.cemper.com/MyGames/duotris.html) |

| Sysiphus II - Sysiphus in Ã„gypten             | the real Sysiphus 2 - great role-playing gameHow do you like the huge title-page? glamour and celebrity on the good old 64 !!Say "J" to load the "demo" (that is this title).*** **beware: do not load the game with fastloader, use F2 in the CCS64.** | Published: GAME ON Magazine 01/92 B via CP Verlag (1992)     | [![sysiphus_in_aegypten_big_title](sysiphus_in_aegypten_big_ti.gif)](http://web.archive.org/web/20160406100959/http://c64.cemper.com/MyGames/sysiphus2.html) | more [here...](http://web.archive.org/web/20160406100959/http://c64.cemper.com/MyGames/sysiphus2.html) |

| Holiday Games                                 | last game released commercially by JEZ + YON creating this multi-discipline game took us a mere 6-8 weeks in the summer holidays. it was tough work with endless work hours but not so well paid for the effort... at least for those times.. | Programmed By: Chris Cemper, Graphics By: Gerald Vogl & Friedrich Flekna, Sound By: Stefan Woltran, Stax & Lorus, Published 1993 on Golden Disk Magazine via CP Verlag | [![title](holidaygames1.gif)](http://web.archive.org/web/20160406100959/http://c64.cemper.com/MyGames/holidaygames.html) | more [here...](http://web.archive.org/web/20160406100959/http://c64.cemper.com/MyGames/holidaygames.html) |
| MineFields                                    | a nice little inbetween game (meaning the coding aswell as for real playing).

| Ice Blaster                                   | Although I finished coding to 99%, I never released this game to public. | Copyright Dome Development 1994??? Who the hell is this? I was not active in 1994 on the c64, therefore I guess they just **stole** it from me? I guess it was again some AMOK-Lamer or G*P boy, giving this to some US-lamers for "cracking" and "fixing"... haha this should never have reached the public... only one person had a copy of it... well... so we know again who was lame... | [![iceblaster ingame](iceblaster_titleyon.gif)](http://web.archive.org/web/20160406100959/http://c64.cemper.com/MyGames/iceblaster.html) | more [here...](http://web.archive.org/web/20160406100959/http://c64.cemper.com/MyGames/iceblaster.html) |
