# Games and Demos developed by Chris Cemper

{{% toc %}}

I went by my short name Chris and the synonym JEZ, as it was popular to have synonyms even if you were not conducting any illegal practices like cracking games or mass-reproducing and selling those cracks afterwards. But my long term friend Gerald Vogl (YON) did that.

Today I can only vaguely remember or actually imagine how hard it was to learn that complex minimal language 6510 assembler and all sorts of hardware exploits, that made these games possible.

I did that by reverse engineering existing code of games and demos. Something that "crackers" did to remove copy-protection. In my case I learnt from other developers code, big time.

Some internal tools developed are not listed, but included

* Graphics editor to support more "fake" colors than the 16 original ones
* Sprite editor to support a multiple of the 8 built-in sprites possible
* Cross-assembler for memory expansion units of 4x or 8x the hardware memory
* Various low-level BIOS hacks that were deployed in hardware (using Eproms "burned" with that assember coder) and replaced physically

My partner Yon took his life in December 1991, which ended our entrepreneurial success story in the C64 games business. **RIP YON.**



## Games developed by JEZ+YON

These games were developed when I was age 14-17.

I remember how this was the first HTML Table I created in my life.

| Duotris                                       | first game released commercially by Jez and Yon. We sent out several copies, all byte-coded (with a special byte in the gamecode that idemtified the recipient in a hidden way...). The byte-code was needed pretty soon when a lamer of AMOK gave a copy of the game to Genesis Project, german cracking-group which boasted by cracking an unprotected game... Well after that we had mere troubles to find someone paying for it, but well.. we did. | Published: Game On Magazine via CP Verlag (1989)             | [![Duotris title](duotris-ingame1.gif)](http://web.archive.org/web/20160406100959/http://c64.cemper.com/MyGames/duotris.html) | more [here...](http://web.archive.org/web/20160406100959/http://c64.cemper.com/MyGames/duotris.html) |

I was not active in 1994 on the c64, therefore I guess they just **stole** it from me? I guess it was again some AMOK-Lamer or G*P boy, giving this to some US-lamers for "cracking" and "fixing"... haha this should never have reached the public... only one person had a copy of it... well... so we know again who was lame... | [![iceblaster ingame](iceblaster_titleyon.gif)](http://web.archive.org/web/20160406100959/http://c64.cemper.com/MyGames/iceblaster.html) | more [here...](http://web.archive.org/web/20160406100959/http://c64.cemper.com/MyGames/iceblaster.html) |

## Disk magazine "Magntic Dreams" developed by Chris Cemper

A very popular form of communication in the 80ies was to produce disk magazines.

Today I would describe them as "multimedia text websites on a floppy disk".

**Magnetic Dreams** was the brand name we used. It is also used by a 3D rendering studio in the US, but that wasn't around in the 80ies.
