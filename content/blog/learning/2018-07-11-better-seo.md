"Christoph, where do you get all your backlink data from?"

"Why do you have so many backlinks?"

"I think that's a scam.‚Äù


## Why my mission is to provide the best backlink data


Don't worry, a lot of people think it's a scam just because they don't know it.

They think that I make this up, but let me tell you that since 2006 my mission is to combine all possible backlink data.

Not to only have the biggest amount of data, but the biggest quality in data, the freshest data.

Exactly what you need for better SEO results.


## Would you trust 5-year old data?


Did you know that when you go to a product like Majestic and download their historic data it's up to 5-year-old data?

Would you make your decisions with 5-year outdated information?

I wouldn't.

My goal is to combine all the data from all of these places and re-crawl it for you.

While these other products are amazing and I love Ahrefs, Majestic and all these, we take their data for your website and make it better.

You have reliable, fresh, quality data for your domain only.


## What LinkResearchTool stands for


This is what you care about right?

It's what I care about, for my clients, for my business.

Abd it's what LinkResearchTools stands for.

If you want to have the best information, the best link data at your fingertips...
