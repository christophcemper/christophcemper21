You know:

I have been doing SEO and link building since 2003 and LinkResearchTools has been public since 2009.

Who cares?

I tell you, a lot of companies, a lot of big businesses work with me - you might know some of themâ€¦


## The SEO tool used big the biggest companies


They are Disney, Linked In, Hertz, 1-800-Flowers, and BankRate.com.

Large agencies, like OMD or retailers like Tchibo, Idealo...you name it.

All these big brands that you know.

If you go to our website [www.linkresearchtools.com](http://www.linkresearchtools.com) and click on 'Customers that love LRT', you will be surprised, you will be shocked.

If you know one big company that we have not worked with before, let me know and I will have a special gift for you.
