Having an e-mail list is one of the most powerful assets a company can have.

Some may even call it the backbone of the business.

A business is founded on giving good customer service and building rapport to your buyers.

What better way to do just that than to send these customers a message about the week’s promotions, news and opportunities.

Too many of us have collected a list over the years just to have it pile up and collect dust in our databases.

If you’re not e-mailing the list, what’s the point of even having that list?

Are you scared of complaints?

If people don’t want to be on your list, they can very easily unsubscribe.

There is absolutely no risk in e-mailing your list, because the other 99.9% of people who open your e-mails will appreciate your message.

The whole point of e-mailing your leads and customers is to provide them value. To give them information.

Important: to buy extra lists is unnecessary.

The foundation of a good e-mail marketing campaign is to have people that know and care about your brand and organization.

If they aren’t interested anymore, get over it!

Just don’t forget the people that want to hear from you.

With love and respect,

Christoph C. Cemper
