Hiring mistakes.

Hiring mistakes happen all the time, but this is not because people are stupid or people are the wrong match.

This is not because they want to play games or tricks.


## Hiring is always hoping for the best


It's because hiring is always assuming and hoping for the best, dressing up really nice, showing up for the interview, talking the talk, walking the walk, doing all these assessments, fully adrenalized.

And then on the first or second day, people just get back to normal and this is where real work starts.


## Interviews are artificial


Let me tell you, over all these years what I learned is that the artificial interview situation is absolutely opposite to what real work sometimes looks like and you need to be aware of that.

No harm done, actually.

Except that you might kill your pink and wet dreams.


## The hiring mistake I made for a long time


I've been there and done that.

I was hoping for the best and for years I thought that the moment I decided it's all gonna work out, the truth is that it is not going to work out.

And many times it did not work out.

If you take that personally, if you take that with frustration, this is just making things worse.

You want to spend as much time as possible up front, but nothing, nothing, nothing replaces actual work.


## How to build the perfect team


This is what it is, I cannot change it, I didn't make it up and this is like in normal life, it's like finding a partner, it's like, you know, it's people.

Working with people over a long time and you cannot play artificial, you cannot trick yourself or someone else over a longer period of time.

OK? So make sure that the first couple of weeks you have full attention from the new team member and the team and have your team report back to you if they don't think it's not a good match.

The people that work with other people, with the new team members matter.
