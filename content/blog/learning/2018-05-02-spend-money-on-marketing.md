One of the main [online marketing mistakes](../../success/online-marketing-results/)? You don't spend money on marketing.

You see:

If you have money to spend and you do not spend it, you have a problem.

Nobody ever made money by saving money.


## Why saving money doesn’t grow your business


If you have a friend who works at KPMG who tells you that you need to put it in the bank to get some savings, you are in the wrong space.

If you are a business person, you have to spend money.

You have to learn, even if it fails.

Then, you have one thing to check off that list.


## Spend money on marketing


Instead of going around and doing brainstorming about what you could do, you could be the person that actually did it.

The person who has the experience, has the T-shirt:

"Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.”

That's my every day saying.
