Are you making this email marketing mistake?


## Why you might be making this email marketing mistake


Let me tell you, that I have probably worked with every email marketing provider out there.

MailChimp, Aweber, HubSpot, Active Campaign, Simplero, you name it.

There are plenty of email marketing tools.

Let me tell you that one thing can go wrong with all of them, whatever they promise you.

Even if you buy a dedicated IP from HubSpot, which was $500/month for one IP address from HubSpot.

If you email and that IP address gets blacklisted...

If you have some kind of reputation problem with that list because you don't use your own opt-in emails or because you do not value the unsubscribe request...

...Then you get into trouble.


## Your whole email marketing strategy could be ruined


You get on the list and this could burn your whole list.

You could churn and burn through your whole list and lose all of them.

It comes down to the IP address and your list reputation.


## Get someone to help you with your email marketing


If you do not have a provider who helps you with that, get someone to do that for you. Get an email marketing expert.

OK?

Listen, if you build up that list and you churn and burn because of aÂ technical glitch, because of a technical misconfiguration, then this is all your fault, your problem and you will lose it all again.
