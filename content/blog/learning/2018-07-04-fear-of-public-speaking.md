Public speaking can start with one person you are speaking to.

Now, imagine that you would not be in a conversation, but talking to a camera, talking to a person that cannot respond.


## What if you wouldnâ€™t have to speak in front of people?


The question "What would they think?" suddenly becomes totally irrelevant, not important anymore.

You speak into a black box and there is no way someone can actually ask a stupid question back.

Isn't that amazing?


## The mindset shift that helps you overcome your fear of public speaking


When you put yourself in that mindset, public speaking is suddenly a piece of cake.

If you have any speaking fears, if you are scared to get on stage, to talk about your stuff, your product, your company, your business, your family, your health, your inventions...

Then. let me tell you this:

Imagine there is no one you are talking to.

You are talking into a black hole.

This would certainly help you.
