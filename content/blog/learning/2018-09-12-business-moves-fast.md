One of our company core values is:

Learn fast and develop yourself.


## We learn something new every day


I've been in business for 14 years.

30 years ago at the age of 13/14, I built computer games and marketed them.

I learn something new every day.

My people learn something new every day.

They understand that whatever they learn in the formal education - I don't care if you have

2 Masters, a PhD and 5 Doctorates - whatever they learned is outdated in the space of online marketing, of online businesses or maybe businesses in general.

I cannot speak for all industries in the same way.


## Business moves fast


But everything that you would call modern technology in the modern business, online world moves really, really fast.

You cannot lean back and say, "I've done it all, I've learned in it all.”

"I've got my degree, now I'm going to make money for the next 50 years and then retire.”

It doesn't work like that.

And I think it never worked like that.


## Learn and develop yourself


I think this is not new, it's just a reminder.

You want to learn fast and develop yourself.

Not just to get your competitive advantage.

But to enjoy yourself in the process.

Learning new stuff is awesome.

If you think learning is bad, then you had the wrong teachers and you have been through the wrong system.

And I guarantee you that you have some things that you love learning.

Try that.
