Online marketing mistakes can happen offline as well.

I'll tell you about a mistake that I made.

For years actually.


## The one offline marketing mistake I made for years


It's people.

If you have the wrong people you will not succeed.

Not succeed in your business.

Not succeed in your online marketing.

And not succeed in your life, in general.

If there is one toxic person on the team, this could take down the whole team.

Believe me, I've been there, done that, got the T-shirt.


## The right people make all the difference


Watch out for which people are around you.

They can push you up, bring you to new levels or drag you down to the mud.

Thank you.
