Did you know that I was a software developer at the age of 13?

No actually at the age of 10.

I had a home computer, a Commodore 64, that I got when I was 10 years old.

I started software developing on it.


## The one thing that changed it all


The big change came at one moment when I built one computer game and I finished it.

Those last 1% were finished.

And then I sold it to a company in Germany who distributed it across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.

All over the place, at the age of 13.

I'm proud to say that I was a commercial software developer in my teenage years.

And it didn't stop there.


## Why you need to finish what you start to get results


This is how early on kids or teenagers can become business people, can become productive, can create something.

But the key is, finishing it.

Everyone has ideas.

Everyone can start stuff.

It's about finishing it. So, putting that extra energy to make that last move, to finish that thing that is annoying that you hate, that you procrastinated about for days.

It's about finishing, finishing that product.

This is what you want.
