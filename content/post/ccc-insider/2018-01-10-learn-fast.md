One of the Cemper core values is:




"Learn fast and develop yourself.”




It's one rule we have for continuous learning, for lifelong learning.




You might have read it on the news and heard people talk about it.




We live that.




## Why is lifelong learning so important?




If you think that just because I turned 44 and have been in business for 14 years, I know how to run my business….




...I actually don't.




You know, I learn something new every day.




I buy trainings, I buy consultancy, I ask experts.




And, I try stuff, I spend money and I learn something new every day.




And every week I am surprised how stupid I was the week before.




Or the month before and especially when I look back after years.




## Even “experts” need to keep learning




So learning never stops and this means your investment in yourself never stops or should never stop.




If you think you are the 'know it all', 'done it all'- let me tell you, this is wrong.




And this mindset will just lead to you and your knowledge becoming obsolete within a couple of years.




So, there you have it. This is why you need to always learn fast and keep developing.




## Learn more about getting the most out of your life and work




In my new book “Spaghetti Code: Detangling Life and Work with Programmer Wisdom”, I talk more about practical approaches you can take to untangle obstacles in your work and life.

I wish you good luck in investing in yourself!
