Want more web traffic from Google?

In that case, did you know that when you search on a search engine, like Google or Bing, there are two different results?


## What you need to know about different search results


There  are paid for results - ads - and organic results.

You might not be aware of that, but there are results that people pay for to be in front of you.

This is how Google makes money.

And then there are organic results, so called free results.
