Do you know where the saying "hire slow, fire fast" comes from?

Oh it's a US thing!

They can hire and fire at will!

Let me tell you that I have friends that are actually proud that the US can fire at will.

I think this is a big, big, big mistake.


## Why hire slow fire fast isn’t great advice


I appreciate the way it usually works for termination periods in Europe.

What this is really about is that you want to make yourself conscious about the fact that work really starts when you work, not in the interview process.

Look, it doesn't matter if you have a huge HR department.

It doesn't matter if you have the best recruiter in the world.

And it doesn't matter if you spend millions or trillions to this headhunter that promises you all kinds of things.

I tell you, the real screening, the real decision if a person has a future on a team happens in the first couple of days and weeks.

Not before.

That's my experience.

That's how we live it.


## Why you should let your team decide


If my team tells me about a new employee not being a good fit for 2 weeks, I just have to execute as CEO.

The team decides.

Let them decide and make sure that your team gets the confidence and the power to actually speak to you about their concerns.
