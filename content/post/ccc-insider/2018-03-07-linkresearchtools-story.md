Why did I build my company, LinkResearchTools?

You know, I used to be a link builder.

I ran an agency for link building and I hired people.

And that’s where it all started.


# I wanted to minimize the time I spent on mindless tasks


My first employee only worked 10 hours.

I didn’t want her to spend a single second working with outdated data.

You see, I started like everyone else just pulling together data manually in Excel.

And I didn't want to pay a single hour back then just gathering data.

Neither do you want to spend time on something so unproductive.

This is why LinkResearchTools was invented.

This is why I built it in 2006 and foresaw so many things related to link building that came later on.


# Today, we help link builders maximize their results


LinkResearchTools was built for link builders by link builders.

Now, of course, we’ve evolved from an agency to a software company.

But, this is the LinkResearchTools story.
