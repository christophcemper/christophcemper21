Have you ever heard the saying:

"If the price is zero then YOU are the product"?

Try to apply that to your learning, to your education, and to your research.


## You’re getting all this information for free? Great! Or…?


I once heard from a guy...

“Well you know, online marketing is really simple because all I have to do is Google around and find all these tricks, find all these 'how to' tutorials.”

And I agree.

There is no shortage of content on the web.

Especially online marketers crank out and push out stuff on a daily basis, on an hourly basis.

There are people who push out a video every 2 hours about some topic.

You think they do it to make you better?

They're not.

This is all just creating leads. It's called content marketing.

It's called inbound marketing.

There’s no free information.


## The secrets are never free


Whatever tag you apply to that, let me tell you that the real goal, the real secret tricks, the real money making difference between YOU and someone else just Googling around would be to go to an expert session.

To go to a paid training or buy, invest into paid trainees.

It could be an online course.

There's no need to fly around the world.

But certainly, the stuff that you find out online is just a teaser.

Always be aware of that.
