Job Interview Questions

What is my second most important job interview question that I have to people applying for a job here?

What do you think?


## Here’s what I always ask job candidates


The first most important one was about the company.

The second question is very simple as well...

Which job are you applying for, what would you do in my company?


## A lot of people don’t even read the job posting


Believe it or not more than 50% of the people that show up, didn't even read the job posting.

Or they come up with ideas of what that job posting would mean, interpreting that instead of reading and asking questions for what we are actually looking for.

Telling me their life stories of what they would like to work on, what they think they might be able to do in the future...

I'm not in the market for that.


## Why this question reveals if they’re a good fit


People who cannot read the job posting in the first place...

...How would they be able to work with my team of high paced, high quality, high performers?

This is what I'm looking for.

If you cannot answer the second question:

“Which job are applying for?”

Then, I have a problem already, I'm sorry.


## Are you a top performer?
