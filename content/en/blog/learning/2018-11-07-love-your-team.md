Let me tell you about how much I love my team.

When I get up in the morning, I look forward to seeing my team.

To seeing specific members on my team.


## Here's why I look forward to working with my team


I think about stuff that I want to talk about with them.

I sometimes put some ideas into Slack already, you know, when I need to get them out of my head.

But this is the way it should be.

And it's not always been like that.


## Why you need to love your team


I had a time in 2014/2015 when it wasn't like that.

I wanted to grow, I wanted to grow fast.

So, I hired people too fast and there was a time in my team, in my company where this was actually not the case.

This was a time when one or two or even three people on the team were a constant problem or a constant annoyance or a constant stress.

You know, getting nervous, not wanting to see them is something that you don't want to happen in your company.


## The solution to a dysfunctional team


And I have been an entrepreneur for 14 years.

Let me tell you, if you have a problem and you cannot get that sorted out by talking to team members...

If you have constant, repetitive, personal issues or, you know, work issues…

As a business owner you have to split ways.

You cannot get yourself out of the company, so no matter how good he or she is, you have to let them go.

Even talent doesn't protect from this.

If it doesn't work; people to people, it doesn't work.

And I have learned this the hard way.


## You need to love your team!


Let me tell you:

If you do not have 100% people in your team that you love, you have a problem.

This is my opinion.

This is what I learned over all these years.
