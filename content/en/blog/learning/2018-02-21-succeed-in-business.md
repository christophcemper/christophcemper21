You know why I built a business?




After I built another business?




Why I built a business in between running LinkResearchTools?




I even built this software startup called Impactana. I built it up, marketed it and then after a pivot, reduced it and formally shut it down.




That was one startup. The rest, I’ve finished. 




# Want to succeed in business? Here’s what you need to do

# The BIG mistake we make




The one biggest mistake in all of our lives, not just business lives, is not sticking to a plan and then giving up.

If you make a conscious decision to stop doing something that you already started but then you stopped selling a product- that's a different story.




But giving up halfway… whether it’s your video logs, blog, business, going after the girl you want, whatever, is quitting.
