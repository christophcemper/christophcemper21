Here’s the thing:

The money that you spend is the money that you make.


## Cheap solutions give cheap results


If you settle for a cheap solution...

If you settle for a free hoster like Blogspot...

And if you seriously consider spending hours every week or every day to blog to create content, on something that you do not have full control over...

Then I'm sorry. You need to rethink your goals.


## Want real results? Here’s what it takes


You need to rethink why you are actually spending all the time.

If you are just testing out and you don't wanna get used to HTML or something like that - yeah I'm just trying, I'm just learning...

Why not do it real?

Why not spend those $10 or $20 a month on proper web hosting?


## Spend money to make money


Because here is the kicker...

You have full control and the moment you start with a proper product that costs money.

In fact, you get exposed to all the opportunities.

You have full control over your web hosting.

And you have full control over whatever you wanna do in the future, once you have some content you want to integrate with other products.

So you wanna do some marketing, you wanna get social, you wanna fix the Facebook thing, you wanna get your share widgets there...

All these things.


## Cheap solutions have a huge risk


Let me guarantee you, if you go for a cheap solution, you will listen to these words:

You will regret it.

You will regret it and believe me:

I spent the first $50 a month or something on web hosting and I never looked back.

I’ve spoken to companies,companies with people, that rent office space that have people on their payroll, that make 6 or 7 figures in revenue, that had their business on a free web host.

Not a good idea.

Nobody ever made money by saving money.

And while you saved maybe a couple of hundred per year on web hosting, I guarantee that you will spend that money on the first problem that you cannot solve.


## SEO requires good hosting


And then we have all the SEO issues.

You need to redirect that website...

You need those links to work...

And you will lose all the traffic.

You will lose your investment.

Your marketing for the last couple of years might go bust overnight, by just changing your web hosting, OK?

How's that? You don't like it?

Then go and get yourself some proper web hosting where you have full control.

Spend money to make money.

OK? Thank you very much.
