Here's a question I get quite often:

"Christoph, why should we audit all the backlinks?"

"Why do you force me to work so hard, to spend more money to audit my 50 million backlinks?"

Here is a simple answer:

Because you have to. Because we all have to.


# Why you want to look at all the data


There's no point in looking just at 500,000 of these backlinks...

Think about it. That's what… 1%?

Yeah.

You don't simply make business decisions with 1% of the data, do you?

You don't take your car to service and make them look at your front lights only.

Nope, you want a full check.

And you expect it.

You expect it from the professional.

And in this case, we are the professionals for links and link audits.


# Do a full backlink audit


My recommendation is:

Do it all or nothing.

If you seriously consider making big decisions based on 1% of the data...

I'm sorry, then we can't help you anymore.

I changed this and I'm happy to do so.

I'm happy and proud of this decision that we don't offer any partial link data anymore.


# Our goal? It’s to offer you the best backlink profile available


Now, it might change again.

We might find more data in the future.

My goal is to provide you with the biggest, best and richest backlink profile that you can get.

This is what LinkResearchTools stands for.

Thank you!
