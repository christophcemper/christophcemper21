### Intro

Christoph C. Cemper is the CEO and Founder of LinkResearchTools and Link Detox. A well-known and distinguished expert in SEO who started link building for clients in 2003, building LinkResearchTools® since 2006 and marketing it as SaaS product since 2009. When the famous Google Penguin update changed the rules of SEO in 2012, Christoph invented Link Detox®, software for finding links that pose a risk in a website’s backlink profile. He introduced ongoing link audits and risk management to the market in early 2011.

### Details

Christoph C. Cemper started developing code at the age of 10, sold the rights on his first own computer game to published at 15. The software industry kept him active since.

Christoph started working in online marketing in 2003, providing link building services. Very soon with his team he developed (the private) LinkResearchTools (LRT) out of the desperate need for reliable and accurate SEO software, and launched to the public in 2009 as a SaaS product.

When the Google Penguin updates changed the rules of SEO in 2012, Christoph had Link Detox® ready within a week due to so much pre-work and quality data available in LRT already. Link Detox helps finding toxic links in a website's backlink profile since. Christoph also introduced the process for ongoing link audits as "Link Risk Management" in 2012.

In 2019 a much higher degree of automation and accuracy was introduced to the public with a complete rebuilt "Smart" product line of LinkResearchTools and Link Detox, providing the user with automated advisory and SEO knowledge patterns applied to the data, so users can focus even more on decisions instead of data gathering.

Today LinkResearchTools is the undisputed leader when it comes to link data quality, backlink profile coverage, and accuracy of link risk assessment.
