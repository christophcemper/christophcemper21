        Objective: Create an Austrian SEO Conference to provide a platform for all German-speaking SEO

        > die SEO Konferenz mit Herzblut

        Responsibilities include:
        * Creating the agenda program as sole content director
        * Create quality guidelines
        * Review all submitted materials
        * Selecting 10-15 speakers from 100s of submissions

        Learnings and Takeaways from running a top Industry Conference
        * You gain immediate visibility and attraction in a market for your "main" business.
        * Deciding who should speak at a conference should never be a solo decision.
        * The logistic challenges of a large (800+ people) event are massive and need a great team.

        I exited end of 2013 to focus on my main business LinkResearchTools.

        My ex-partner Oliver Hauser runs the show ever since, even more successful than the first 4 years.
